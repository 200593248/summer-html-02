        <h2>Lyrics</h2>
        <p>         Maybe it's the way you say my name<br>
            Maybe it's the way you play your game<br>
            But it's so good, I've never known anybody like you<br>
            But it's so good, I've never dreamed of nobody like you<br>
            And I've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime<br>
            And I'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine<br>
            'Cause I'm in a field of dandelions<br>
            Wishing on every one that you'd be mine, mine<br>
            And I see forever in your eyes<br>
            I feel okay when I see you smile, smile<br>
            Wishing on dandelions all of the time<br>
            Praying to God that one day you'll be mine<br>
            Wishing on dandelions all of the time, all of the time<br>
            I think that you are the one for me<br>
            'Cause it gets so hard to breathe<br>
            When you're looking at me, I've never felt so alive and free<br>
            When you're looking at me, I've never felt so happy<br>
            And I've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime<br>
            And I'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine<br>
            'Cause I'm in a field of dandelions<br>
            Wishing on every one that you'd be mine, mine<br>
            And I see forever in your eyes<br>
            I feel okay when I see you smile, smile<br>
            Wishing on dandelions all of the time<br>
            Praying to God that one day you'll be mine<br>
            Wishing on dandelions all of the time, all of the time<br>
            Dandelion, into the wind you go<br>
            Won't you let my darling know?<br>
            Dandelion, into the wind you go<br>
            Won't you let my darling know that?<br>
            I'm in a field of dandelions<br>
            Wishing on every one that you'd be mine, mine<br>
            And I see forever in your eyes<br>
            I feel okay when I see you smile, smile<br>
            Wishing on dandelions all of the time<br>
            Praying to God that one day you'll be mine<br>
            Wishing on dandelions all of the time, all of the time<br>
            I'm in a field of dandelions<br>
            Wishing on every one that you'd be mine, mine</p>
